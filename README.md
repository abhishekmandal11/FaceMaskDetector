# FaceMaskDetector

**Description:**
The Real-Time Face Mask Detector project is a Python-based application designed to detect whether individuals in a given frame of a video stream or an image are wearing face masks or not. This project utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to analyze and classify faces into two categories: "with mask" and "without mask".

**Requirements:**
- TensorFlow>=1.15.2
- Keras==2.3.1
- Imutils==0.5.3
- Numpy==1.18.2
- Opencv-python==4.2.0.*
- Matplotlib==3.2.1
- Scipy==1.4.1

**Installation:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Usage:**
1. Run the main Python script `train_mask_detector.py` using the following command:
   ```
   python train_mask_detector.py
   ```
2. Follow the instructions provided in the terminal or command prompt to select the input source (e.g., webcam, video file).
3. The application will start detecting faces and classifying them as "with mask" or "without mask" in real-time.
